# Creature-Clicker
A clicker heroes style game that I've written for fun in my free time. Here is a screenshot for those curious: https://ibb.co/XJWLJH4
The empty rectangles on the bottom of the JFrame are place holders for future functionalities such as an items shop and special abilities. 
The green bar on left side is the creatures health bar, which descreases with each click on the creature.
The white bar on the right is the timer which constantly descreases while the "play" button is activated. You must defeat the creature before the 
timer runs out in order to unlock the next creature. 

Project is currently on the back burner while awaiting more creature art from a friend. Thanks for checking it out!
